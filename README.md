## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning implementation on the **California Housing Prices dataset**, originally from the 1990 California census. The project follows the methodology presented in *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow"* by Aur√©lien G√©ron.

**Objective**: Develop accurate predictive models for estimating median house values in California districts based on demographic, economic, and geographic features.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains housing information from the 1990 California census with the following features:

**Numerical Features:**
- `longitude`, `latitude` - Geographic coordinates
- `housing_median_age` - Median age of houses in the district
- `total_rooms` - Total number of rooms in the district
- `total_bedrooms` - Total number of bedrooms in the district
- `population` - Population in the district
- `households` - Number of households in the district
- `median_income` - Median income of households (in tens of thousands of USD)
- `median_house_value` - Target variable (in USD)

**Categorical Feature:**
- `ocean_proximity` - Proximity to the ocean (5 categories)

**Source**: R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry (1997), modified by Aur√©lien G√©ron.

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of all features
- Correlation analysis between features and target variable
- Geospatial visualization of housing prices across California

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values in `total_bedrooms` column
- One-hot encoding for categorical variable `ocean_proximity`
- Standardization of numerical features

### 3. Feature Engineering
Created more informative derived features:
- `rooms_per_household` = total_rooms / households
- `bedrooms_per_room` = total_bedrooms / total_rooms
- `population_per_household` = population / households

### 4. Modeling Approaches
- **Baseline Model**: Linear Regression
- **Advanced Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### 5. Model Deployment
- Web application built with Flask for real-time predictions
- Docker containerization for easy deployment

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Local Installation

```bash
python app.py
```
Access the application at: http://localhost:5000

### Making Predictions via API
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"longitude": -122.23, "latitude": 37.88, "housing_median_age": 41, \
"total_rooms": 880, "total_bedrooms": 129, "population": 322, \
"households": 126, "median_income": 8.3252, "ocean_proximity": "NEAR BAY"}' \

### Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**: RMSE = $68,000-72,000
- **Random Forest Regressor**: RMSE = $48,000-52,000 (‚âà30% improvement)

## üîç Key Insights

1. **Income Dominance**: Median income shows the strongest correlation with house prices (‚âà0.69)
2. **Location Impact**: Coastal properties (<1H Ocean / Near Bay) command premium prices
3. **Feature Engineering Benefits**: Derived ratio features (rooms per household, etc.) provided more predictive power than raw counts
4. **Non-linear Relationships**: Tree-based models outperformed linear regression, indicating complex non-linear patterns in the data
5. **Spatial Patterns**: Clear geographic clustering of housing prices, with coastal areas and urban centers showing higher values

## üîÆ Future Work

- Experiment with advanced boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Implement systematic hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
- Develop interactive geospatial visualizations using Folium or GeoPandas
- Incorporate additional data sources (crime rates, school quality, amenities)
- Implement deep learning approaches for potentially improved performance
- Develop a more sophisticated web interface with interactive visualizations
