🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning implementation on the California Housing Prices dataset, originally from the 1990 California census. The project follows the methodology presented in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

Objective: Develop accurate predictive models for estimating median house values in California districts based on demographic, economic, and geographic features.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains housing information from the 1990 California census with the following features:

Numerical Features:

· longitude, latitude - Geographic coordinates
· housing_median_age - Median age of houses in the district
· total_rooms - Total number of rooms in the district
· total_bedrooms - Total number of bedrooms in the district
· population - Population in the district
· households - Number of households in the district
· median_income - Median income of households (in tens of thousands of USD)
· median_house_value - Target variable (in USD)

Categorical Feature:

· ocean_proximity - Proximity to the ocean (5 categories)

Source: R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry (1997), modified by Aurélien Géron.

🔬 Methodology

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

· Distribution analysis of all features
· Correlation analysis between features and target variable
· Geospatial visualization of housing prices across California

2. Data Preprocessing

· Handling missing values in total_bedrooms column
· One-hot encoding for categorical variable ocean_proximity
· Standardization of numerical features

3. Feature Engineering

Created more informative derived features:

· rooms_per_household = total_rooms / households
· bedrooms_per_room = total_bedrooms / total_rooms
· population_per_household = population / households

4. Modeling Approaches

· Baseline Model: Linear Regression
· Advanced Model: Random Forest Regressor
· Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

5. Model Deployment

· Web application built with Flask for real-time predictions
· Docker containerization for easy deployment

Model Performance

· Linear Regression: RMSE = $68,000-72,000
· Random Forest Regressor: RMSE = $48,000-52,000 (≈30% improvement)

🔍 Key Insights

1. Income Dominance: Median income shows the strongest correlation with house prices (≈0.69)
2. Location Impact: Coastal properties (<1H Ocean / Near Bay) command premium prices
3. Feature Engineering Benefits: Derived ratio features (rooms per household, etc.) provided more predictive power than raw counts
4. Non-linear Relationships: Tree-based models outperformed linear regression, indicating complex non-linear patterns in the data
5. Spatial Patterns: Clear geographic clustering of housing prices, with coastal areas and urban centers showing higher values

🔮 Future Work

· Experiment with advanced boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
· Implement systematic hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
· Develop interactive geospatial visualizations using Folium or GeoPandas
· Incorporate additional data sources (crime rates, school quality, amenities)
· Implement deep learning approaches for potentially improved performance
· Develop a more sophisticated web interface with interactive visualizations
