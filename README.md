🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to build accurate predictive models for estimating median house values in California districts. The implementation follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

· Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
· Data cleaning and preprocessing
· Feature engineering and selection
· Model training and evaluation
· Deployment via web application

The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and developed using GitHub Codespaces.

📊 Dataset

Source: Originally from R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry (1997), modified by Aurélien Géron for "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow".

Features:

· longitude, latitude - Geographic coordinates
· housing_median_age - Median age of houses in the district
· total_rooms - Total number of rooms in the district
· total_bedrooms - Total number of bedrooms in the district
· population - Population of the district
· households - Number of households in the district
· median_income - Median income of households (scaled)
· ocean_proximity - Categorical variable indicating proximity to ocean
· median_house_value - Target variable (median house value in USD)

🔬 Methodology

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

· Distribution analysis of all features
· Correlation analysis between variables
· Geospatial visualization of housing prices
· Identification of data quality issues

2. Data Preprocessing

· Handling missing values in total_bedrooms column
· One-hot encoding of categorical variable ocean_proximity
· Standardization of numerical features

3. Feature Engineering

Created more informative derived features:

· rooms_per_household - Average number of rooms per household
· bedrooms_per_room - Proportion of bedrooms to total rooms
· population_per_household - Average household size

4. Modeling

Implemented and evaluated multiple algorithms:

· Linear Regression (baseline model)
· Random Forest Regressor (primary model)
· Evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

5. Model Interpretation

· Analysis of feature importance
· Model performance comparison
· Error analysis and visualization

🌐 Web Application

The project includes a Flask web application for making predictions interactively.

Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t house-price-app .
docker run -d -p 80:5000 house-price-app
```

Then access at: http://localhost

💡 Key Insights

1. Median income is the most influential factor in predicting house prices (correlation ≈ 0.69)
2. Geographic location significantly affects prices:
   · Coastal properties (<1H Ocean / Near Bay) command premium prices
   · Inland properties are generally more affordable
3. Feature engineering substantially improved model performance:
   · Ratio features (rooms per household, etc.) provided more meaningful signals
   · Reduced multicollinearity among features
4. Tree-based models (Random Forest) outperformed linear models by capturing non-linear relationships

🚀 Future Work

· Experiment with advanced boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
· Implement systematic hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
· Develop interactive geospatial visualizations with Folium or GeoPandas
· Create automated ML pipeline with MLflow for experiment tracking
· Implement model monitoring and drift detection in production
