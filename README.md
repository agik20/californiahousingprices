# 🏡 California Housing Prices – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning implementation on the **California Housing Prices dataset**.  
The dataset originates from the 1990 California census and is famously used in *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Explore the California Housing dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualize key patterns and correlations.
- Train predictive models to estimate **median_house_value**.

This project is implemented in **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** and developed using **GitHub Codespaces**.
